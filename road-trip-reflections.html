    <h3>In four short weeks, I have driven through significant portions of <strong>26 states</strong>, for a total of over <strong>140 car hours</strong>, for <strong>nearly 9,000 miles</strong>...</h3>
<p>... And I'm a little exhausted, to say the least. I feel like I have a lot to say, but it's still not yet fully absorbed. Every time I open up my text editor to write something about this trip, I wonder if I'm doing wrong by my experience in only picking small pieces to talk about. It makes this writing feel a little shallow, and incomplete, but hopefully that despite my inability (and complete inexperience in both traveling and writing) to write a book, this will do. Here are some things people have asked me along the way, that I finally have time to answer.</p>
<p>Remember <a href="http://www.eartsar.com/day-fifteen-portland.html#day-fifteen-portland">that poet from Portland</a>? The poem he wrote for me is apt here.</p>

  END OF THE ROAD
  i am returning home
         after a journey
                 that I will never forget
                 for it has changed me
                and enlightened me
             to just how big this country is
                     with so much diversity
                           state to state
                   I followed the map of fate
                        stopping and wishing
                           I could stay
                   now I am inspired to
                        return to places
                     I left too soon
                 until then I have a wealth of
                      memories to replay
             cherished day after day

<p><strong>How and why did you intend to record your trip?</strong></p>
<p>Some people suggested I do a journal (how old school). Others told me to take pictures. Some said video. With so little time to spare along the way, I figured the best thing to do would be to combine all of these things into one amateurish effort in the form of this blog. You got low-quality cell phone pictures, windshield-mounted GoPro clips, and barely passable words all on the same page for the world to see and come back to. Doing it this way, I was able to publish with minimal internet (I did a few posts from a cell phone, no wifi), and the content isn't tied to any particular platform.</p>
<p>I felt like I might want to read my thoughts on the trip in the future. I actually once blogged my year that I spent in France, which I did revisit a few times. Lastly, I didn't want to be living on social media or constantly texting/emailing people updates. By posting it with a metaphorical megaphone, I didn't have to worry about keeping people suitably in the loop... or accidentally leaving anyone out.</p>
<p>It felt awkward for the first two nights (didn't help that I was somewhat sick), but I think I got a little bit better at it as time went on.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>What were your favorite parts of the trip?</strong></p>
<p>While my gut feeling is that it's somewhat wrong to choose favorite parts of the trip, there were definitely moments that stood out to me. <strong>New Orleans</strong> was easily my favorite <em>city</em> out of all of the cities we had visited. The food, the music, and the lifestyle were infectious. People say that it's a place best visited during Mardi Gras, but honestly, the parties don't stop on Frenchman Street - they just get even more crowded. I personally would be more inclined to visit during Halloween, where there are likely to be less bachelorette parties, and more street-side shows going on.</p>
<p><strong>The Grand Canyon</strong> at sunrise was easily my favorite <em>moment</em> of the trip. It's massive, and the canyon takes up the entirety of your view - it's a sight that's not overrated. However, I can't imagine seeing the canyon at any other time except sunrise (or maybe sunset), where it's constantly changing colors, and the natural shadows sort of stretch out from each outcrop. There are also fewer people around, and it's much easier to get a really good spot without wading through crowds.</p>
<p><strong>Yellowstone and Wyoming</strong> made up my favorite <em>portion</em> of the trip. Each sight is like a little natural wonder of the world, and there are several within spitting distance of one another. You're surrounded by stunning displays of nature, and plenty of wildlife roam the park grounds with you. Aron and I had spent so much time in just the first tiny portion of the park that I had to tell myself to just let go - if one takes a picture of each amazing thing, you'll be looking at the park through a lens, and will hardly move from the same spot.</p>
<p>While these are my picks for superlatives, there were so many highlights of the trip. In fact, I'd go on to say that I only wrote about the highlights, and glossed over plenty of smaller things that Aron and I did as we made our lap around the country.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>What were your <em>least</em> favorite parts of the trip?</strong></p>
<p>I didn't care for the southern stretch of the trip nearly as much as the rest, with the exception of NOLA. We found plenty of things to enjoy (the beaches by the Gulf of Mexico, the Texas State Fair), but overall, it wasn't really so compelling. At one point we had gone into a small store in Alabama that had a sign saying "those with baggy pants are not welcome here". When looking at the locals, and their fashion habits, it was easy to see which groups were being targeted by such a sign. The Texas State Fair - while Aron really liked it - felt really trashy. It's all of the unflattering things you get in a fair, except ten times bigger. The Champlain Valley Fair was much higher in terms of quality.</p>
<p>In terms of driving, I assert that I have no idea what purpose Idaho serves to this country outside of supplying us with potatoes.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Did you miss anything that you wish you had seen?</strong></p>
<p>We didn't walk across the glass bridge at the Grand Canyon, though honestly, with where we were and what we saw, I'm not it would have added much to our experience. "Next time". I also missed going to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_on_the_Rock">House on the Rock</a>, which was a <strong>HUGE</strong> bummer, because of how much I love American Gods. I even planned on going here, but completely forgot in the moment of the trip. Pretty huge screw-up, and by the time we realized our mistake, it would have taken out six hours of Chicago. A total lose-lose situation.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>What's with the timing of your trip? Four weeks? October?</strong></p>
<p>So I had a few things that, for better or worse, forced the timing of this trip. Firstly, I had to accrue the necessary vacation time. Secondly, nerd fest was right in the middle of October, and I wanted that to be the midpoint of the trip. The closure of Yellowstone and Cedar Point for winter just so happened to line up perfectly with our visits with minimal adjustment. Together, these things really forced a timeline that fit within the window of time I could take off from work. <em>If I didn't have a specific time I wanted to be in Vegas</em>, I could have done the entire trip at any point during the spring-to-autumn months.</p>
<p>For reasons I mentioned in my blog (foliage changing colors, few people in Yellowstone, overall crisp weather and no snow), I'm somewhat inclined to think that October is a great month to do what I did, and might even be the best option.</p>
<p>Something that I didn't really anticipate was that taking four weeks allows you to visit all of these places in the same slice of time. The political climate of the country didn't change from start to finish. The weather was in the same autumn-to-winter transition that it's been in all month. October is a sleepier month for traveling, and I didn't ever really feel swamped with tourists.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>If you were to do it all over again, what would you change?</strong></p>
<p>This is a big question, and I break it up into two hypothetical trips: the <em>Four Weeks Lap</em>, merely adjusting what I did, and the <em>Fleshed Out Lap</em>, which are stupid names I made on the fly just now. These are trips that <em>I</em> would do, assuming I had the same trip goals, and knowing what I know now, if I had four weeks, and six weeks, respectively.</p>
<p>For a four week lap, this is assuming you're also from Vermont, and have seen a lot of the northeast.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut out a day from Vegas, spend it in Austin instead of Dallas.</li>
<li>Go to SF or LA instead of Sacramento</li>
<li>Cut out a day from Chicago, spend it in Minneapolis</li>
<li>If you cut out Rochester, go from Ohio to Vermont in one day</li>
<li>If you cut out Cedar Point, spend that day somewhere else. Santa Fe, Nashville, Memphis, Atlanta were good options. Swinging down to Colorado is also doable if you have one or two days to play with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, there are too many amazing places in this country to visit in one trip. Period. You'd have to take a year off to really do a complete trip justice. I had to learn to take people's suggestions in stride - I took some, but had to leave others by the wayside.</p>
<p>For a more filled out six week trip, I'd do what I mentioned above, but spend a few more days in the southeast - a week if you go into Florida (but... is it really worth it?). I'd do LA in addition to SF, and go up to Seattle after Portland. You also might have a few days to play with for New York or Boston - though I've personally been there enough.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Did you get sick of driving after a while?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Not really.</strong> There were small stretches (getting to Sacramento, going through Idaho) that were kind of rough after a few hours, but overall it really helps having a car that you enjoy driving. Aron and I also had a loose system - if you felt motivated to drive, just do it, and keep going until you have to tap out. We didn't have defined shifts. This meant sometimes I did all the driving on a particular day, and sometimes Aron did the majority. Between our music, audiobooks, the car, and our swapping system, driving almost never felt like a chore, and the time flew by. I would say that these points were critical for having a successful road trip, at least for us.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Music? Also, what's with King Kunta?</strong></p>
<p>When I was driving, I found myself returning to <strong>Odesza</strong>, <strong>Thievery Corporation</strong>, and <strong>CHVRCHES</strong> a lot. Aron did a lot of <strong>Panic! At the Disco</strong>. We listened to the entire <strong>Incubus</strong> discography at least once.</p>
<p>When sick of music, we finished up the Riyria Revelations audiobooks.</p>
<p>King Kunta is meant to be listened on loop endlessly.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Did you get along with your brother for the four weeks you two were stuck in a car?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Aron's easy to get along with. He wanted to murder me somewhere in Idaho. I nearly left him out in the middle of the Badlands. Besides those moments, things went just fine.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Overall, what did you learn from the trip?</strong></p>
<p>I think that I, and probably people in general, really underestimate the vastly different cultural identities that these regions have. It's easy to identify as American, and to view all these places as American going in, but when I actually visited some of these places, I came to the realization that I didn't have a remotely complete mental image of what "American" truly is. When I walked into New Orleans, I thought "creole". When we drove into Santa Fe, I thought “Spanish". We hit up Cody, Wyoming - perhaps in some ways a quintessential American town - and it turns out that the culture of that place feels separated from the rest of the country entirely.</p>
<p>It's perhaps an accusation to say, but even recognizing these vastly different cultures as all being American doesn't quite do it either. Who hasn't said, out loud, <em>we're so diverse</em>? Yet, so few of us - especially us younger folk - really know what that means beyond a mere concept. And this concept is completely separate from seeing a sight so very unique - something so different from where you may hail from, that relating is impossible. Seeing and absorbing the dissonance one feels in knowing both this other place you're in, and the place you're from, are American, but have so little in common is so integral to the road trip experience. It's a sentiment that I felt often (it's impossible to avoid), and only in repetition did I feel like I was started to "get it"... and in turn "getting" what being an American really is. That despite visiting a dozen different worlds, they all make up a greater whole of this country. You don't see this degree of diversity when walking down the streets of New York, or reading a Times article filled with so many well taken pictures. You don't appreciate it by merely acknowledging that it exists. You have to confront it yourself.</p>
<p>Even the places that were more familiar to me, be it through common media or a sense of familiarity - places such as Chicago, Vegas, and Portland, even they must feel as foreign to someone else, as NOLA and Cody felt for me.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm speaking in circles, but the imagine of America that I had prior to this trip was one that I felt only mildly affiliated with, and it was one akin to an equation that has a textbook definition. In taking this trip, I was working through the equation myself by living in its example problems every day.</p>
<p>So I suppose the greatest thing that I've come to absorb in this trip is that now when I hear - or maybe say - that "America is so diverse", it becomes more than a talking point. It's a reality that I can now visualize and actually carries weight, because I've now seen "diversity"'s many faces. With this comes a degree of respect and appreciation for these sub-cultures that I didn't really have before. I can only imagine how much more profound these realizations would be given more time in each location.</p>
<p>With all this comes an appreciation for the country as a whole, too. Before this trip, my degree of interest in seeing more "America" was so much lower than that of going abroad. Part of the original motivation for this trip was almost some sort of point that I wanted to prove to myself. Part of me had expected to be underwhelmed, such that I could say that I "did America" already, and could therefore focus my future travels elsewhere in the future. <em>How wrong I was</em>. I'm more amazed than I've ever been at how such a young country could contain so much richness. It's an aspect of this country that I'm not ashamed to be proud of, even though the time I spent discovering it was so brief.</p>
<p>I learned that this country is large. I know how far two cities are in terms of miles, in terms of hours, and in terms of culture. I learned what diversity looks like, and feels like, and tastes like. I learned how beautiful the country is, at all elevations, and in each corner of the map. Probably most importantly, I learned that it's completely possible experience all of these things (at least at this stage in my life) - all I had to do was plot a course, and start driving.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
