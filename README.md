# Lap One Blog

If you're reading this, I guess you either care about me or what I did to make the blog. Well, since I wanted to spend as little time as possible, this just uses pelican, with the Flex theme, and the disqus plugin. Plugins aren't managed properly because I didn't read the docs. I had no time to set this up, and I'm working on the blog from hotel rooms. Sue me.
