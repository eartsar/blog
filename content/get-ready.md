### About This Trip
Chances are this isn't coming as a complete surprise to you, if you're reading this, but I'm going on a road trip. My first, actually. I've got some pretty horrible company, and we'll undoubtedly be listening to King Kunta on repeat for hours. **It's my first lap around the country**.

Not all destinations are listed there, nor are those the actual routes we'll be taking. I expect quite a bit of meandering along the way. Here's a condensed itinerary:

* In **Washington D.C.**, I'll be meeting up with my college friend Bryce, and he's going to take us into D.C. proper and Alexandria.
* **Atlanta**, a pass-through. If the show was any indication, I'm quite okay with that.
* **New Orleans**, we'll be staying right on the French Quarter on a Saturday and Sunday. Hoping for plenty of jazz and creole style food.
* Then on to **Dallas**, passing through. Screw Texas.
* **Santa Fe**, passing through, but we'll have some time to look around.
* Ah... the **Grand Canyon**, the American Wonder that's allegedly *not* overrated.
* After that, we're going to go straight to **Las Vegas**, where we'll be meeting up with a dozen or so friends of mine. Three days. We've got shows planned here, but since people from work might be reading this, I can't go into more detail.
* Meandering north will take us to **Sacramento**, where we'll be staying with more friends. We'll spend a day in San Fransisco while we're here.
* A long hike north, passing **Crater Lake** on the way, will take us to **Portland**. Childhood friend lives there, and hopefully we'll be staying with her. A rest day follows.
* An even *longer* hike gets us to **Rigby** in Idaho, just an hour out from Yellowstone. We'll meander through the next day (the whole day!), and end up in **Cody**, Wyoming. It's supposed to be beautiful. Two nights in a cabin.
* Heading over to **Rapid City** for Rushmore - an American Wonder that allegedly *is* overrated.
* Minneapolis is up next. Passing through, but we'll take our time in doing so.
* Big stop next in **Chicago**! Staying with a bunch of friends there. Looking forward to Second City comedy club! Three days.
* After which, just a hop and skip away, is **Sandusky**, Ohio - Cedar Point time. I'm still a kid.
* **Rochester**, New York. We have a Halloween party to attend with some college buddies.
* If all goes well, I'll reach **Burlington** on the 2nd of November.
