&lt;p&gt;... And I'm a little exhausted, to say the least. I feel like I have a lot to say, but everything I've seen and done are still not yet fully absorbed. Every time I open up my text editor to write something about this trip, I wonder if I'm doing my experience a disservice in only picking small moments to talk about. It makes this writing feel a little shallow and incomplete, but hopefully that despite my inability and inexperience in both bookwriting and traveling, this little post will do. Below, I'm going to share some things people have asked me along the way - questions that I finally have time to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember &lt;a href="http://www.eartsar.com/day-fifteen-portland.html#day-fifteen-portland"&gt;that poet from Portland&lt;/a&gt;? What he had written for me is particularly appropriate, here.&lt;/p&gt;

  END OF THE ROAD
  i am returning home
         after a journey
                 that I will never forget
                 for it has changed me
                and enlightened me
             to just how big this country is
                     with so much diversity
                           state to state
                   I followed the map of fate
                        stopping and wishing
                           I could stay
                   now I am inspired to
                        return to places
                     I left too soon
                 until then I have a wealth of
                      memories to replay
             cherished day after day
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How and why did you intend to record your trip?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people suggested I do a journal (how old school). Others told me to take pictures. Some said video. With so little time to spare along the way, I figured the best thing to do would be to combine all of these things into one amateurish effort in the form of this blog. You got low-quality cell phone pictures, windshield-mounted GoPro clips, and barely passable words all on the same page for the world to see and come back to. Doing it this way, I was able to publish with minimal internet (I did a few posts from a cell phone, no wifi), and the content isn't tied to any particular platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt like I might want to read my thoughts on the trip in the future. I actually once blogged my year that I spent in France, which I did revisit a few times. Lastly, I didn't want to be living on social media or constantly texting/emailing people updates. By posting it with a metaphorical megaphone, I didn't have to worry about keeping people suitably in the loop... or accidentally leaving anyone out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt awkward for the first two nights (didn't help that I was somewhat sick), but I think I got a little bit better at it as time went on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were your favorite parts of the trip?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my gut feeling is that it's somewhat wrong to choose favorite parts of the trip, there were definitely moments that stood out to me. &lt;strong&gt;New Orleans&lt;/strong&gt; was easily my favorite &lt;em&gt;city&lt;/em&gt; out of all of the cities we had visited. The food, the music, and the lifestyle were infectious. People say that it's a place best visited during Mardi Gras, but honestly, the parties don't stop on Frenchman Street - they just get even more crowded. I personally would be more inclined to visit during Halloween, where there are likely to be less bachelorette parties, and more street-side shows going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Grand Canyon&lt;/strong&gt; at sunrise was easily my favorite &lt;em&gt;moment&lt;/em&gt; of the trip. It's massive, and the canyon takes up the entirety of your view - it's a sight that's not overrated. However, I can't imagine seeing the canyon at any other time except sunrise (or maybe sunset), where it's constantly changing colors, and the natural shadows sort of stretch out from each outcrop. There are also fewer people around, and it's much easier to get a really good spot without wading through crowds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yellowstone and Wyoming&lt;/strong&gt; made up my favorite &lt;em&gt;portion&lt;/em&gt; of the trip. Each sight is like a little natural wonder of the world, and there are several within spitting distance of one another. You're surrounded by stunning displays of nature, and plenty of wildlife roam the park grounds with you. Aron and I had spent so much time in just the first tiny portion of the park that I had to tell myself to just let go - if one takes a picture of each amazing thing, you'll be looking at the park through a lens, and will hardly move from the same spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these are my picks for superlatives, there were so many highlights of the trip. In fact, I'd go on to say that I only wrote about the highlights, and glossed over plenty of smaller things that Aron and I did as we made our lap around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were your &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; favorite parts of the trip?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't care for the southern stretch of the trip nearly as much as the rest, with the exception of NOLA. We found plenty of things to enjoy (the beaches by the Gulf of Mexico, the Texas State Fair), but overall, it wasn't really so compelling. At one point we had gone into a small store in Alabama that had a sign saying "those with baggy pants are not welcome here". When looking at the locals, and their fashion habits, it was easy to see which groups were being targeted by such a sign. The Texas State Fair - while Aron really liked it - felt really trashy. It's all of the unflattering things you get in a fair, except ten times bigger. The Champlain Valley Fair was much higher in terms of quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of driving, I assert that I have no idea what purpose Idaho serves to this country outside of supplying us with potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you miss anything that you wish you had seen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't walk across the glass bridge at the Grand Canyon, though honestly, with where we were and what we saw, I'm not it would have added much to our experience. "Next time". I also missed going to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_on_the_Rock"&gt;House on the Rock&lt;/a&gt;, which was a &lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt; bummer, because of how much I love American Gods. I even planned on going here, but completely forgot in the moment of the trip. Pretty huge screw-up, and by the time we realized our mistake, it would have taken out six hours of Chicago. A total lose-lose situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's with the timing of your trip? Four weeks? October?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had a few things that, for better or worse, forced the timing of this trip. Firstly, I had to accrue the necessary vacation time. Secondly, nerd fest was right in the middle of October, and I wanted that to be the midpoint of the trip. The closure of Yellowstone and Cedar Point for winter just so happened to line up perfectly with our visits with minimal adjustment. Together, these things really forced a timeline that fit within the window of time I could take off from work. &lt;em&gt;If I didn't have a specific time I wanted to be in Vegas&lt;/em&gt;, I could have done the entire trip at any point during the spring-to-autumn months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons I mentioned in my blog (foliage changing colors, few people in Yellowstone, overall crisp weather and no snow), I'm somewhat inclined to think that October is a great month to do what I did, and might even be the best option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that I didn't really anticipate was that taking four weeks allows you to visit all of these places in the same slice of time. The political climate of the country didn't change from start to finish. The weather was in the same autumn-to-winter transition that it's been in all month. October is a sleepier month for traveling, and I didn't ever really feel swamped with tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you were to do it all over again, what would you change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big question, and I break it up into two hypothetical trips: the &lt;em&gt;Four Weeks Lap&lt;/em&gt;, merely adjusting what I did, and the &lt;em&gt;Fleshed Out Lap&lt;/em&gt;, which are stupid names I made on the fly just now. These are trips that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; would do, assuming I had the same trip goals, and knowing what I know now, if I had four weeks, and six weeks, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a four week lap, this is assuming you're also from Vermont, and have seen a lot of the northeast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut out a day from Vegas, spend it in Austin instead of Dallas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to SF or LA instead of Sacramento&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut out a day from Chicago, spend it in Minneapolis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you cut out Rochester, go from Ohio to Vermont in one day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you cut out Cedar Point, spend that day somewhere else. Santa Fe, Nashville, Memphis, Atlanta were good options. Swinging down to Colorado is also doable if you have one or two days to play with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there are too many amazing places in this country to visit in one trip. Period. You'd have to take a year off to really do a complete trip justice. I had to learn to take people's suggestions in stride - I took some, but had to leave others by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more filled out six week trip, I'd do what I mentioned above, but spend a few more days in the southeast - a week if you go into Florida (but... is it really worth it?). I'd do LA in addition to SF, and go up to Seattle after Portland. You also might have a few days to play with for New York or Boston - though I've personally been there enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you get sick of driving after a while?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not really.&lt;/strong&gt; There were small stretches (getting to Sacramento, going through Idaho) that were kind of rough after a few hours, but overall it really helps having a car that you enjoy driving. Aron and I also had a loose system - if you felt motivated to drive, just do it, and keep going until you have to tap out. We didn't have defined shifts. This meant sometimes I did all the driving on a particular day, and sometimes Aron did the majority. Between our music, audiobooks, the car, and our swapping system, driving almost never felt like a chore, and the time flew by. I would say that these points were critical for having a successful road trip, at least for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music? Also, what's with King Kunta?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was driving, I found myself returning to &lt;strong&gt;Odesza&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Thievery Corporation&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;CHVRCHES&lt;/strong&gt; a lot. Aron did a lot of &lt;strong&gt;Panic! At the Disco&lt;/strong&gt;. We listened to the entire &lt;strong&gt;Incubus&lt;/strong&gt; discography at least once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When sick of music, we finished up the Riyria Revelations audiobooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Kunta is meant to be listened on loop endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you get along with your brother for the four weeks you two were stuck in a car?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Aron's easy to get along with. He wanted to murder me somewhere in Idaho. I nearly left him out in the middle of the Badlands. Besides those moments, things went just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall, what did you learn from the trip?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that I, and probably people in general, really underestimate just how different the various cultural identities in this country are. It's easy to identify as American, and to rationalize each stop along the way in a trip like this as getting another taste of what is American. It's what I got excited for, with this trip, and what I had been not-so-subtly bragging for such a long time before departing. It sounds inspiring, and really highlights a romantic view one might have (I know I did) of the diversity of this country. Then, when I actually visited some of these places, I came to the realization that I didn't have a complete mental image of what "American" truly is. When I walked into New Orleans, I saw "Creole". When we drove into Santa Fe, I saw “Spanish". We visited Cody, Wyoming - perhaps in some ways a quintessential American town - and it turns out that the culture of that place feels separated from the rest of the country entirely. Visiting all of these places turned all of my preconceived notions of diversity into a laughable textbook image of what this country is truly all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's perhaps an accusation to say this. However, even recognizing these vastly different cultures as different faces of a diverse America doesn't quite fill in a complete image, either. I imagine anyone reading this blog has voiced, probably out loud, &lt;em&gt;this country is diverse&lt;/em&gt;. Yet, I have a hunch that so few of us - especially us younger folk, who have only just begun to live our lives - really understands what diversity really is beyond a mere concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been to many places, and seen many things, each one American, and yet completely unrelatable to the flavor of America I've known my whole life. &lt;strong&gt;This dissonance is beautiful, and absorbing it over and over again was integral to the road trip experience.&lt;/strong&gt; It's a sentiment that I felt often (it's impossible to avoid), and only in repetition did I feel like I was started to make peace with the fact that these things and places did not have to remain alien to me. That reveling in this crazy mashup of worlds is to revel in what may be the greatest pleasure of being American - the fact that it's all my home, and I'm free to collide my experience with the rest. That being American is about giving a little of myself where I go, and taking a little bit of somewhere else back home with me. That diversity is bewilderment, and amazement, and excitement, and wonder, and that it's all beautiful and amazing to have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't see this degree of diversity when walking down the streets of New York, or reading a Times article filled with so many well taken pictures. You don't appreciate it by merely acknowledging and understanding that it exists. You have to confront it yourself, and I'm so glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I'm speaking in circles, but the image of America that I had prior to this trip was one that I felt only mildly affiliated with, and it was one akin to a mathematical formula. In taking this trip, I was working through the equation myself by living in its example problems every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I suppose the greatest thing that I've come to absorb in this trip is that now when I hear - or maybe say out loud - that "America is so diverse", I think I know now what that means. It's a reality that I can now visualize, and one that actually carries weight, because I've now seen "diversity"'s many faces. With this comes a degree of respect and appreciation for these sub-cultures that I didn't (and couldn't) really have before. I can only imagine how much more profound these realizations would be given more time in each location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this comes an appreciation for the country as a whole, too. Before this trip, my degree of interest in seeing more "America" was so much lower than that of going abroad. Part of the original motivation for this trip was almost some sort of point that I wanted to prove to myself. Part of me had expected to be underwhelmed, or at least exactly "whelmed" as much as I expected, such that I could say that I "did America" already, and could therefore focus my future travels elsewhere in the future. &lt;em&gt;How wrong I was&lt;/em&gt;. I'm more amazed than I've ever been at how such a young country could contain so much richness. It's an aspect of this country that I'm not ashamed to be proud of, even though the time I spent discovering it was so brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned that this country is large. I know how far two cities are in terms of miles, in terms of hours, and now in terms of culture. I learned what diversity looks like, what it feels like, and what tastes like. I learned how beautiful the country is, at all elevations, and in each corner of the map. Probably most importantly of all, I learned that it's completely possible experience all of these things, because I did - all I had to do was plot a course and start driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...I can't really think of a more fitting closure for the trip. While we didn't get to head through Amish country on Friday (too far out of the way), we did take the time to visit some friends located in South Bend, Indiana along the way. We could definitely feel home drawing near. All mid-to-large cities from Indiana onwards to the east have a similar pseudo-rust-belty feel to them. The buildings are all outdated (they were modern once, I suppose), and not very flattering. Skylines are somewhat unimpressive, and the weather seems to be more cloudy than not, and yet somehow, people don't seem too miserable. Our minor detour aside, we arrived at our AirBnB location in Vermillion Ohio (near Sandusky) in a very low-key and uneventful few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day brought more excitement. We met up with one of my best friends from college at the park right at opening time, and enjoyed a day of non-stop coasters for twelve fun-packed hours. For anyone who hasn't been to Cedar Point, they take their coasters &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; seriously, with some of the country's most intense finding an appreciative home in the park. We hit up most of the iconic ones, my favorites being &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbXPhOFRxTc"&gt;Millenium Force&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEydyLJ-wjw"&gt;Valravn&lt;/a&gt;. I probably prefer Valravn the most, as it's likely the most intense coaster at the park while still being an insanely smooth and painless ride. Unfortunately, Top Thrill Dragster was closed due to winds, but we did all the other coasters worth doing. Thank goodness for the line-cutting pass!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forgive the lack of pictures for Cedar Point rides. It was a sea of humanity, and I had Aron hold my phone most of the time since he wears woman's jeans with vacuum-sealed tight pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a lot more going on at the park beyond just coasters, though, as it was the last weekend of being open before closure. Cedar Point celebrates Halloween by opening up haunted rides and mazes throughout the month of October, and completely transforms after the sun sets. It's actually really stunning, and all of the park's staff is really energetic. They managed to spook me many, many times - I'm a really easy target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left the park by midnight, and after a few drinks (and gushing over our favorite rides), we went home. The following Sunday was an easy travel day, as Sandusky is a hop-and-skip west of &lt;strong&gt;Rochester&lt;/strong&gt;, my college home turf. Sunday night game night, filled with fun and friends, was fantastic. I didn't get to see everyone (not by a long shot), so if you're reading this wondering why I didn't stop by... Rochester was just a coincidental drive-through - I'll see you soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we got up early to hit some of my favorite spots. I have yet to see any coffee shop come even remotely close to my personal favorite, &lt;a href="http://www.joebeanroasters.com/"&gt;Joe Bean&lt;/a&gt;. We also hit up the &lt;a href="http://www.museumofplay.org/"&gt;Strong Museum of Play&lt;/a&gt;, which has an entire floor filled with retro arcade games - all of them in impeccable condition. Our brief Rochester stop ended with lunch at &lt;a href="http://www.dogtownhots.com/"&gt;Dogtown&lt;/a&gt;, which is where you go for the most delicious heartburn. I skipped the garbage plate (if you know what that is) since I had to still drive six hours to get home. Call me risk-averse...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just so happens my favorite food/drink spots lead to explosive combinations. I handled this with &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt;. Please, I'm a professional Rochesterian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are only a few of my favorite spots in the small city, but they are probably the best ones. Rochester is a really odd place. It feels like it's way past it's prime, the days of Kodak and Xerox are pretty much over, but the city absolutely refuses to fall into a rut like those companies. It's a great place with thriving artists, plenty of academics, and some great "upstate New York" (read: bad for you) food. It never quite felt like home, but whenever I visit, it welcomes me back happily. And so I'll keep returning to visit. It was nice to share this piece of life with my brother, as Aron had never really been in Rochester before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left early this afternoon, and I write this post now from the living room of my parents' house. Needless to say, they were thrilled to see me again after four weeks. I also really welcome having a day to unwind, let it all sink in, and prepare for my return back to work on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, day twenty eight, I'll really reflect on the trip as a whole and share my thoughts on what I liked the most, and what I would change if I were to do it all again sometime. It's still a bit surreal that I've been all over the country - from New Orleans to Portland - all within the past few weeks. So many places that I miss, and so many places that remind me of how much I love Burlington - a place that truly does feel more like home than any other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you'll come back to hear those thoughts. Thanks for letting me share these small pieces of my trip with you. The trip's over, but we'll always have &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/eitanromanoff/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Day Twenty through Twenty Four (Rapid City, Badlands, Minneapolis, Chicago)</title><link href="https://eartsar.github.io/blog/day-twenty-through-twenty-four-rapid-city-badlands-minneapolis-chicago.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-28T02:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-28T02:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Eitan Romanoff</name></author><id>tag:eartsar.github.io,2016-10-28:blog/day-twenty-through-twenty-four-rapid-city-badlands-minneapolis-chicago.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Is it sad that the majority of my US history comes from visiting memorials, and watching The West Wing...&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...rather than from the textbook readings of my education? It's not really surprising to me, especially when you consider the quality of displays such as the Lincoln Borglum Museum at Rushmore National Memorial. These exhibits do a good job of beckoning viewers to dig deeper and learn more about this country's history and its various endeavors. Also fitting that they'd place a national memorial in the middle of nowhere, South Dakota, where you'll have time to let it all sink in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing Rushmore in person was a bit as one would expect. The sculpture is massive (it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a mountain, after all), but the vantage point is far enough that the details of the Presidents' faces are softened by the distance to which they are viewed. Because of this, the display remains in the distance, and doesn't take up the visitor's entire view, which gives the impression that the work of art is smaller than it truly is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving Rushmore, we drove eastward, and before too long, arrived at another popular national park - the Badlands!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Yellowstone, where you get some pretty vast variety of climates and creatures, the Badlands is an archiologist-or-geologist's paradise. It's a lot more easily driveable, with less wildlife, and the vistas are more of a wonder in the sense that it's a showcase to the power of a changing climate over time. It's inspiring much in the same way that the Grand Canyon is, and the sense of scale that each vista provides reminds the viewer how small one human really is. There are also rattlesnakes, and plenty of ledges to get nervous keeping balance on. Watching Aron skip along the edge of some of these vantage points really makes my gut sink, and I'm not sure if it helps bring out my inner courage or stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, from there it was a long drive out to &lt;strong&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/strong&gt;, where we had a nice room booked for the night. Minneapolis is one of the locations that I really had to cut from the trip to make room elsewhere (in this case, Cody Wyoming). It didn't take long to realize that we were really missing out on some fun stuff, though the city seems to have more to do when the weather is warmer. Still, we had some coffee, a light breakfast, and made sure to stop off at &lt;a href="http://www.electricfetus.com/"&gt;Electric Fetus&lt;/a&gt; before heading out. I picked up some stuff - apparently it was a sale day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this was really just "stuff along the way" to &lt;strong&gt;Chicago&lt;/strong&gt;, though, where we stayed with some friends for a few nights. They were also out in Vegas with us, though we admittedly didn't see too much of them there as we knew we were coming here later. The weather is wonderful and totally cooperated with us for the first half of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chicago feels really similar to New York in a lot of ways - something I'm sure many natives of both cities would get angry at me for saying. It has its food differences (Chicago dogs vs NYC dogs ... Chicago pizza vs NYC pizza) where both items are really entirely different beasts. They have their different sports teams (the amount of hype in this city over the Cubs is unreal right now), they have their different neighborhoods, their different accents, but ultimately, they felt very similar. Big buildings, a lot of people, true venues to see the country's "melting pot" premise in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up doing a decent chunk of stuff while here, mostly things that I wanted to do for fun rather than to truly be inspired. Day one started with brunch at &lt;a href="http://www.littlegoatchicago.com/"&gt;Little Goat&lt;/a&gt; diner. Aron was really excited for this, as the owner/head chef is a top chef winner. I'm pleased to say the food is really good - we had a lot of it, and it was all fantastic. Don't ask me to remember what I ordered, it was some Japanese egg thing with pork belly and it was perfect. I even got some granola to go for the road which I promptly ate the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bellies filled, we went to &lt;a href="http://www.sheddaquarium.org/"&gt;Shedd Aquarium&lt;/a&gt;. We didn't have a whole lot of time to spend here, but I've been to plenty of aquariums before. Shedd was really nice (it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; usually get put on the top five lists for the country), in large part because of how modern and well kept it is (so much better than Boston), but it was really great seeing the beluga whales they have there. That made the visit worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we were off to &lt;a href="http://www.secondcity.com/"&gt;Second City&lt;/a&gt; - a famous comedy club that puts on a hell of a show (we saw 105th revue), and I'm also pleased to say that it was a smash hit for us. I had the pleasure of seeing Second City once in Toronto, which was easily the best comedy show I've ever seen in my life. This one approached that same level of hilarity (didn't quite hit it!), and was worth every penny and moment spent there. If you ever get the chance to see a Second City show - do yourself a favor and go. The third act for this one had one of the best comedy sketches I've ever seen in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish off the evening, we went and got some authentic deep dish at Lou Malnati's. Before you groan at the choice, listen here. I've read more opinions on deep dish rankings than anything else on this entire trip, and if I've learned one thing, it's that five people manage to have six opinions on the best deep dish pizza in the city. It tasted really good, and while I prefer my thin crust pies, the gigantic mass that this city calls a pizza filled me with calories, bloat, satisfaction, and shame... all at once. It was great pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day two was a bit more low-key. The weather played nicely, so we decided to go back downtown. We perused the Field Museum, which had some really great exhibits, one in particular being Tattoo art and history. It was really interesting (par for the course response for museum reactions), especially so since it's a subject I knew nothing about at all. The rest of the day we dedicated to walking the city, and getting more food. What's for dinner? Japanese BBQ at one of the &lt;a href="http://www.gyu-kaku.com/chicago"&gt;Gyu-Kaku&lt;/a&gt; locations, of course! It was really good. Afterwards we went home and had a game night with our friends. It was a really good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, we leave for &lt;strong&gt;Cedar Point&lt;/strong&gt;. We'll be heading through some Amish country, I think, and I likely won't make another post until we get to Rochester (I won't be describing each roller coaster, to spare you, and you're welcome). We're on the last leg of the trip at this point, and while these last few trips will be a lot of fun for &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, it won't be as interesting or novel to share. I'll likely end on a check-in from Rochester, and then maybe some sort of fancy reflection post when I get back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I've complained a lot in these posts about the brevity of each stop, and expressed a desire to come back to spend more time. It's undoubtedly, to at least some extent, driven by some mixture of guilt and wonder. The trip was always meant to just be an endless string of teasing stops, but the intent was that I would be moving on before getting too attached to any one place along my visit. With the exception of Vegas, I haven't truly been to any of these locations that I've written about before - so I honestly had no intention of becoming so enamored with any particular stop. Then we went through Yellowstone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we stayed in Cody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very briefly last time, I had mentioned that I was staying at &lt;a href="http://applejackranch.com/"&gt;Apple Jack Ranch&lt;/a&gt;, a place that I had found through AirBnB. I was tired, and still taking everything in from Yellowstone when I had written the previous post on my cell phone. I didn't really quite notice that I had struck gold in terms of lodging choices. When we arrived, everything was pitch black, and I was really looking forward to seeing some of the last moments of the Orionids light show in the night sky (it was a fruitful endeavor). Exhausted and blog post written (and committed to the repo, and deployed, all from an android ssh session - what a pain), I passed right out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up to the sound of paws prodding the deck just outside the door. In my six thirty in the morning delirium, I ran through the various possibilities. Perhaps, it was one of the many rabbits we saw scurrying away from the car as we approached the cabin the night before. Perhaps it's the owner's dog, which I had vaguely remembered existing. But this is Wyoming, of course. It could be something a great deal more feral. Maybe even a grizzly (don't laugh - apparently last year, one approached our very cabin)! Being the brave soul I am, I creaked open the door just a tad, and in the darkness of morning I saw something somewhat large, on all fours, looking right back at me for a moment before hopping off the porch. Out of instinct, I of course closed the door again immediately to contemplate what I had just saw. It was this guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain that being maimed wasn't likely on the immediately list of accomplishments for the morning, I opened the door once more, and saw the big canine staring back at me on the dirt road. I approached him (leaving Aron behind to sleep in, as per usual), and he padded onwards. Any time he got a bit ahead, he looked back. A short walk up the road led me to a side door at precisely seven in the morning, right about at first light. I opened up to the smell of coffee, and smiling faces. Less than a minute later, we were all deep into conversation regarding travel and more. Around an hour later, everyone put their mugs away, since it was time to do some work - bringing in the horses so that their vet (a family friend of theirs) could check in on their breeding progress. I was about to excuse myself, but minutes later, I found myself keeping Johanna and Bounty company as they fetched their small group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the morning, I caught myself slipping into the mentality of an inquisitive child, asking a whole slew of questions, and watching the pair work. And while I'm somewhat sad to say I didn't really offer anything in terms of help - I didn't get in the way, either! The fact that they humored my curiosity was a delight on its own. Over the course of the weekend, plenty of time was spent just gazing over the ranch, at the mountains in the distance, or at the stars in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the afternoon, Aron and I spent mostly in town. Interestingly enough, we had stopped in at a museum called the &lt;a href="http://www.centerofthewest.org/"&gt;Buffalo Bill Center of the West&lt;/a&gt;. I wasn't really sold on the museum - we had passed by it while driving through the town on the way the previous night - but it came with a pretty strong endorsement from Bounty, so we stopped in. It's easily one of my favorite museums I've ever stepped into (it's a Smithsonian affiliate) - and it's massive, with five sections which are each basically a smaller museum on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Native American History, western art, natural wildlife exhibits, historical collection of the evolution of firearms, and a museum dedicated to Buffalo Bill (and other western icons) kept us entertained for hours. Similar to Meow Wolf, time just slipped away from us because it was legitimately very interesting, and much more engaging than most other museums I've ever been to. At some point, there were a few falconers-of-a-fashion who brought in some of the native birds to show off and talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our grumbling stomachs informed us that we had spent somewhere around five hours browsing the museum, and it was time for an early dinner. We picked out a good looking spot, and I had me some Bison Burger. It was good - leaner than beef burgers, but just as juicy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived back on the ranch near sunset, and spent time in the company of our hosts (their little boy, too), and the aforementioned vet friends, near a cozy fire pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following morning was welcoming and familiar to the one before. This time, Rooster (the dog) and I decided to have a race up to the house. Rooster won, but just barely. More coffee, more conversation, and a home cooked breakfast later, it was time to go. In writing all this, it almost seems as though I give the impression that not much happened, but it's really just the opposite. Time felt suspended, if for a brief moment in the trip, and I felt the most relaxed I had ever been in years. At one point during my stay, I had asked Bounty and Jo if the sights of the mountains, and the lifestyle they chose become "normal" or "just another day" for them. They looked content when they told me no. I'm sure I'm glossing over many little things, but I'll be coming back to Apple Jack Ranch - and Yellowstone - for a bit of a longer stay next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aron and I reluctantly parted from Cody, and drove through the very picturesque Big Horn National Forest before arriving at Rapid City. Tomorrow, we wake up early to see Rushmore, and to drive through the Badlands a little bit, and eventually rest for the night in &lt;strong&gt;Minneapolis&lt;/strong&gt;. The next big portion of the trip to come is &lt;strong&gt;Chicago&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and my subpar pictures don't really do it justice. New Orleans was a city I was the most excited to see. Seeing all my friends in Vegas was an event I was looking forward to the most. The Grand Canyon was the sight I was most excited to view. When it comes to the general portion of the trip, however, Yellowstone is perhaps the part I was most excited for since I started planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As anyone reading this is &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; aware, I'm not the most outdoorsy guy. I code a lot, and read a lot. I'm okay with staying indoors. This trip is a huge step out of my comfort zone - not that I'm afraid to travel, just the opposite, and am quite good at getting around unfamiliar areas - but the act of abandoning familiarity is one I have to really convince myself to do. This portion of the trip, Yellowstone and Wyoming in general (Cody is such a fantastic little town), really epitomizes this departure from the familiar. The culture here is one of respect for the wild, self sufficiency, and pleasure in solitude - as our AirBnB hosts put it - and it's one that I'm growing quite fond of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aron and I left Portland a bit late, and had a very long and arduous drive ahead. The first few hours were rainy, the middle few hours were empty, and the last few hours were pitch black. Thursday was uniquely a travel day, and we didn't really see much outside of our route. It's a bit of a shame... we missed some great waterfalls outside Portland (the visibility would have been near zero anyway with the weather), and didn't take into account jumping ahead one hour - and our projection to reach Twin Falls at sunset more than just a bit off. Needless to say, when we arrived in Rigby, Idaho, we were in no mood to do much at all besides sleep. Aron, in particular, was quite finished with my company, and probably with good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really good, maybe necessary even, that Friday was the single greatest day of the trip. We departed early, and drove about two hours to get to Yellowstone at around half past nine. Yellowstone, at this point in the year, is in the final stages of winding down services for closure during the winter season. All of the hotels and inns are basically closed within the park, and many places outside the park also close due to the slow business. The towns are relatively empty, there are no lines of cars in the park. There are fewer rangers (I think), and no in-park facilities beyond toilets, a year-long medical hub, some ranger stations, and a couple of self-serve unattended gas stations. Of course, it's not completely empty, but the park has only a fraction of its normal volume of tourists. It's amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having entered the park from the western gate (via West Yellowstone), we snaked our way to all of the major landmarks. We saw the thermal pools, including the Grand Prismatic Spring, on the way to the Old Faithful geyser. All of these sights were a really cool reminder that Yellowstone is a bit of an anomaly, as far as national parks go, as it sits on top of an active volcanic area that enables its many unique features. It's got several flavors of habitat in one region that can all be visited in one day (if you show up when we did), each one beautiful in its own right. Old Faithful was maybe the most overrated thing in the park, but even still, it was really impressive. I would say that all of the thermal sights are more interesting scientifically than they are inspiring. I'm quite happy that we started off with this portion of the trip, as I'm not sure we would have been as attentive to these sights later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we looped around to West Thumb, which is a point on the large lake that lives in the southeastern quadrant of the park. There were some really magnificent views along the way, and having spent a few hours at this point, we were getting kind of hungry. I had picked up PB&amp;amp;J ingredients earlier, being the gourmet chef that I am, and we found a quiet spot by the lake to make our lunch. A tiny drop of jelly fell to the ground, and the birds descended upon it almost immediately. They jelly. This stop resulted in the only food picture I'll ever be proud of in my entire life (because food pictures are stupid, and if you asked me to take them, you're a horrible person).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that was the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, which many people say rivals the Grand Canyon in Arizona for its various sights, rather than scale. It's a compelling argument. Our spot of choice was near the Lower Falls, a mere 5/8 mile walk downhill to the brink of the falls (and a painfully steep 5/8 mile back up later...), which leads to an excellent vantage point. On the way back up, I was asked several times "is it worth it", to which I mostly just grinned like an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, we went west, and looped around the northwest quadrant of the park, which houses Mammoth Springs. The stop here was brief, not because we didn't want to see the springs, but because these sections were a filled with larger wildlife that we could see up close (as close as possible without committing a crime - I made sure we weren't "those guys"). Given our general drought of wildlife up to this point, we jumped on the opportunity to observe these beasts up close. Unfortunately, we didn’t see any moose (they’re smaller than their Vermont cousins, I believe) or bears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm glossing over plenty of things we saw along the way in the park, but the complete map has endless vistas for viewing, and trails to hike. You couldn't spend a month here and do everything, though if you show up in the last week of October, you can do all the "iconic" things in a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left the park at sunset through the northeastern gate, and poor Aron drove us an hour and a half to Cody on the windy scenic highway. It was a rough drive, but was all worth it in the end as we let the sights of Yellowstone sink in. I can't do it justice with just some crappy smartphone pictures and a rambly blog post, so I'll put it this way... Along with the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone Park is something that every American should see in their lifetime. People find this country endearing for different reasons, but I'd say that these sights make up the most compelling reason of all. I owe it to myself to come back (likely many times) in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up early to excellent conversation with my Cody, WY AirBnB hosts (&lt;a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/7074708?guests=1&amp;amp;s=41&amp;amp;user_id=45085958&amp;amp;ref_device_id=f1884a3f398e525"&gt;here's a link to the listing&lt;/a&gt;, HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT), and then wrangled some horses with them. We'll be seeing a bunch of stuff here in Cody (and maybe making the hour trek back to Yellowstone, if Aron ever wakes up), so I'll have more to post on this beautiful corner of the country tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, there are plenty of other pictures, as per usual, at my &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/eitanromanoff/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. Though, you can just as easily book a flight to come out here yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Day Fifteen (Portland)</title><link href="https://eartsar.github.io/blog/day-fifteen-portland.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-20T00:28:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-20T00:28:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Eitan Romanoff</name></author><id>tag:eartsar.github.io,2016-10-20:blog/day-fifteen-portland.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;We've officially passed the half way point...&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...both in terms of time (15 out of 28 days) and distance (over 5000 out of around 9000 miles traveled). It's yet another reminder that this trip won't last forever, and that staying for so little time in each spot lets us part before we get too attached. It's bittersweet, but perhaps getting a mere taste of each city is what allows the visit to be all the more inspiring. Each stop is a small cliffhanger, and hopefully I'll be able to resolve each one before too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, today was our full day in &lt;strong&gt;Portland&lt;/strong&gt;, city of microbrews, bars, strip clubs, food, and nature. As per the recommendation of an Uber driver from last night, and corroborated by everyone else we asked, we decided to hit up a place called &lt;a href="http://screendoorrestaurant.com/"&gt;Screen Door&lt;/a&gt;, which allegedly has the best brunch ever. The rumors weren't really wrong - everything was pretty top notch and in huge portions... the only problem is that it's all Louisiana style! I did my best not to unfairly compare the dishes to what I ate a mere week and a half ago. My worries, thoug, were unfounded, as everything seemed to live up to the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we ate just enough to go from satisfied to self-hatred, we bounced and ventured over to &lt;a href="http://www.powells.com/locations/powells-city-of-books"&gt;Powell's City of Books&lt;/a&gt;, the flagship location of the indepedent bookstore chain. Whereas the Strand is a bit of an institution in Manhattan, this bookstore is an annexed haven for literature without the claustrophobia of being in New York City. The store is seriously massive, and every shelf has a great deal on a lightly used book for a killer price. I ended up leaving with a hardcover copy of The Math Book, and another on some computer science theory. Aron got a bunch of children's books, including a copy of Good Night Moon and the 11th hour. I wonder if this says something about our academic aptitude (it doesn't).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also ventured up into the rare books room, which was the one area where The Strand wins out for sure. Still, it was really cool seeing a first edition 1984 for 500 dollars. Perhaps just as cool as the bookstore itself, I saw a guy sitting outside with a typewriter and a jar of colored pieces of paper with a pretty welcoming smile on his face, and a sign that denoted an offer for a custom poem - given a prompt. Aron and I had seen a few of these arists in NOLA some time prior, but they were all really busy with other people's creations, and I never got the chance to get one for myself. I told him briefly that I was on a trip, around the country, and that I'd like a poem now that I was over halfway done and heading eastward towards home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Road trip is done! I moved this poem appropriately to my &lt;a href="http://www.eartsar.com/road-trip-reflections.html#road-trip-reflections"&gt;reflections post&lt;/a&gt;, and you can read it there. Also, &lt;a href="http://www.typewritertroubadour.com/"&gt;his website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the bloat of the massive meal we had this morning started to set in, so we grabbed a quick ride up to the top of &lt;a href="http://pittockmansion.org/"&gt;Pittock Mansion&lt;/a&gt; - one of the historic sights in the city. The best part, by far, was the excellent view of the city from high up (picture at the top), as well as the miles long trails that are woven through Forest Park. It's quite beautiful, and it was a really easy walk. We ventured out to the rose gardens, but they were mostly closed, as there are few roses to show off at the end of October. A shame, but a nice walk nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really afraid that walking a whopping three miles would have burned too many calories from this morning, so we took a trip down to the very iconic (and allegedly overrated) &lt;a href="http://voodoodoughnut.com/"&gt;Voodoo Doughnut&lt;/a&gt; shop. The shop is a bit touristy, and sometimes has some awful lines, but it's a must-do at least once if in Portland. Luckily for us, few people were looking for hefty doughnuts at five in the afternoon on a Wednesday. I grabbed a box of their most popular offerings, and we brought it back to the hotel room for eating while Aron and I watched the debate. The debate went about as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before too long, our friend Janice got off work again. We met up with her and some of her friends at her favorite dive bar, Club 21, for some booze and cajun fries. It was pretty okay, but eating and drinking with friends made it taste all the better. We miss you already, Janice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...where the mountains are of a completely different scale than those of the Green Mountains on the northeast, especially when you're winding around and through them the entire time. We were a bit worried about the drive being pretty rainy and treacherous, but luckily for us, our route mostly cleared up by Tuesday afternoon. We weren't completely lucky, though, as Crater Lake had absolutely zero visibility from the rim village, and was very icy. Because of this, we decided to skip, and get to Portland earlier. This was a huge disappointment for me - I had grown up with a massive atlus of the country that used to sit on top of our family's fridge for the longest time. I used to open it up, and look at various landmarks around the country, and one of the coolest ones that always stood out was the lake on top of the mountain in Oregon. Unfortunately, it'll be a sight for a different trip. We did get a bit of a consolation present in the form of clear skies above Mount Shasta, though (pictured above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive, as a whole, was beautiful. Really breathtaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Portland at around 9:30, and called our good friend Janice, who grew up in the Mad River Valley like us. She told us to get our butts over to &lt;a href="http://www.portlandwings.com/"&gt;Fire on Mountain&lt;/a&gt; for a sampling of some of Portland's finest wings and sauces. Sounded good to us! We had penaut sesame, bourbon bbq, sweet bbq, and standard buffalo sauces. The wings were pretty good, and the cajun fries that we grabbed with them were fantastic with a banana barbeque sauce. Yum!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards we hit up one of the many bars on the southeast side - 2.50 pints, and quarter-per-play skee ball. Can't really beat that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and while I'm not exactly sad to leave Las Vegas, I am sad to leave my friends. Our shared time is always way too short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vegas itself really pales in comparison to &lt;strong&gt;New Orleans&lt;/strong&gt;, our other city in our trip that revolves around night life. Vegas is loud, it's artificial, it's commercial, and it's kind of insincere in how everyone's looking to have a good time. I can't help but continue to compare the two cities, because the parties in NOLA were much more soul fulfilling than anything else we've seen. While I suppose it's possible people actually enjoy blasting top 100 hits, and drinking copious amounts of booze, it's a lot more fun when the music is live and shifts with the energy of the crowd. The party there is a collaborative effort everyone contributes to, in order to have a good time. In Vegas, you either join in out of obligation, or get left behind. It really wouldn't be fun to come back here solo - I'm glad we met up with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We woke up early on Sunday morning to check out of the hotel and head over to &lt;a href="http://lionhabitatranch.org/"&gt;Lion Habitat Ranch&lt;/a&gt;, a lion sanctuary that has a collection of rescues, as well as others born on the sanctuary grounds itself. The sanctuary wasn't quite as big as I was expecting, but it was a good time. I got to make conversation with the sanctuary's volunteers and staff, asking them about the efforts they make in working there, and learned a good deal about the difficulties in maintaining the sanctuary, and some of the more academic and preservation projects that they host. I feel conflicted about the sanctuary - a lot of these animals couldn't exist in the wild, but it's still a bit sad to see the majestic creatures just getting by in relative captivity, even if the sanctuary seemed to me to be a more academic and humane effort. Needless to say, it was a more sincere attraction than the noise of the Vegas Strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about half past noon, it was way beyond time for Aron and I to take off. We reluctantly said our goodbyes (we'll be seeing some of them in the near future in Chicago) and hit the road for &lt;strong&gt;Sacramento&lt;/strong&gt; - a manageable nine hour hike north. Plus well over an hour of delays... we ended up arriving late at half past one in the morning. Thankfully, our Sacramento friends (who flew back from Vegas) were ready to receive us super late. After a quick game of &lt;a href="http://www.explodingkittens.com/"&gt;Exploding Kittens&lt;/a&gt;, we crashed and slept in the following morning. Something we love about our Sacramento friends - they're huge foodies, and were eager to bring us to one of their favorite spots for a late brunch, &lt;a href="http://thewaffleexperience.com/"&gt;The Waffle Experience&lt;/a&gt;, where we had a slew of delicious waffles (surprise).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bellies filled, we roamed a bit of the Sacramento Capital Mall. Regan - Ronald Regan &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;. Also, the Governator. Aron and I were so exhausted, that we were cool taking it east in Sacramento for the day, rather than travel two hours into San Francisco (and back), and not recoup. Besides, I've been to SF a few times now, and it was nice seeing a slightly different side to California that isn't &lt;strong&gt;infected&lt;/strong&gt; by the &lt;strong&gt;virus&lt;/strong&gt; that is Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hours seemed to fly by pretty quickly, and before too long our foodie friends took us to have some seriously legit Mexican street food at &lt;a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-paisano-taco-truck-woodland"&gt;El Paisano Taco Truck&lt;/a&gt;. Aron and I weren't sure how confident our stomachs were for it - PTSD from the Santa Fe breakfast burritos, probably - but after having a sampling of the, we quickly got a second helping. I had the carnitas tacos, and they were fantastic... and only a buck fifty a pop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to end the post here, we're about to play some Settlers of Catan or something for a little game night before we leave tomorrow for &lt;strong&gt;Portland&lt;/strong&gt;. Crater lake on the way... I'm worried about the weather. There's been some thunderstorms hitting the region as of late, but delaying a day in Sacramento doesn't solve the issue - the weather will be rainy (snowy by Crater Lake) regardless. It's going to be a pretty long trip (9 hours), and with less than ideal weather, probably making it take an extra hour or two longer if we play it safe. Hoping for the best, and that it clears out for the Portland to Yellowstone leg of the trip. Gulp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...to be able to view the Grand Canyon at daybreak. Everyone who has seen it before was telling me how necessary it was to see this this American wonder, but it was our hosts in &lt;strong&gt;Santa Fe&lt;/strong&gt; that convinced us to delay our viewing to be at sunrise. They described the changing colors, the necessity of going a bit beyond just the safety of the railings, and the thrill of watching the sun rise over the eastern ridge. So we did so, and for the first time in the trip, Aron and I were cranky and not really willing to talk much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But our grumpiness slowly faded as we approached the state park. We were one of the first ones to get to the observation point (Mather Point), and got prime seats. We couldn't really even see the canyon originally, because it was so dark. The sky out here is ridiculously crisp, and without any light pollution, we had a full view of the starry sky above. And so, we waited in below freezing weather, watching people slowly trickle in - dads with their sons, a few couples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 5:30 in the morning, the sun's slight started to filter into the sky, and the early moments of sunrise began. With it, the canyon's color transformation started, going from a dusky grey, to a subdued blue, and warming to a soft orangey brown. It was truly incredible. So much so, that we decided to leave the safety of the railing, and go out onto one of the rocky outcrops jetting into the center of the canyon. It wasn't a particularly difficult climb down (a bit narrow, with a hell of a deadly drop if you stumble), but Aron and I played it a bit safe and went slowly. We were rewarded, as we so often are in this trip, with some killer pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked into our hotel rooms (three of them), and dumped off the car in the garage - we had friends to gather. It took a bit, but we eventually all got together and roamed the Vegas Strip. From there on, we had the usual fare of libations, liberations, and laughs, but we called it a bit early (we were tired). Friday is where the fun began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday morning, we decided to get some of our "nerd fest" stuff out of the way. The "reason" for a lot of us coming out at once was due to a convention for some game I used to play, with some of my friends being those I met in the game, and others that I knew prior that joined along with me. So, since we dropped money on these tickets, we figured to at least show up at the keynote. In all honestly, it felt like a waste of time, so we all bounced right after and hit the strip again. We had a lot of good food, like crepes (we're at the Paris Las Vegas, after all!)...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... without any real plan or goal. Vegas is a good time with friends, though I have to say, compared to &lt;strong&gt;New Orleans&lt;/strong&gt;, it's a bit underwhelming. Whereas New Orleans had the party as a lifestyle, it's just so commercialized here in Vegas. Ah well, it's nice to kick back, play, and drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many other things I haven't shared here. Meals we had, and things we're doing. But Aron and I are late to go see Cirque du Soleil, and I have to end the post here! I'll have a part two after we arrive in &lt;strong&gt;Sacramento&lt;/strong&gt; that goes over a bit more of the Vegas leg of the trip.

&lt;p&gt;...Because we were so reluctant to leave &lt;strong&gt;Santa Fe&lt;/strong&gt;. Honestly, what a great surprise this town has been - it's really an absolute gem in the middle of the desert and mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We awoke early this morning to get a glimpse of the mountains at around sunrise. It was cold - maybe under forty five degrees - and that took me by surprise, since we had been traveling through 90+ degree weather to get there. We ended up befriending our host's &lt;em&gt;extremely friendly&lt;/em&gt; dog, and it was really difficult to say goodbye this morning. After a brief farewell walk, and some belly scratches, we managed to say goodbye (to hosts, too - the goodbyes, not the belly scratches). Aron contemplated dog theft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up going to &lt;a href="http://www.pantrysantafe.com/"&gt;The Pantry&lt;/a&gt;, which is a local favorite with very typical New Mexico style food. We had two breakfast burritos - mine with chorizo, because chorizo is the best breakfast meat - and of course, chile on top... Christmas style. I liked the red chile's flavor a little better, but the green chile was also amazing (and really hot). It was easily the best breakfast burrito I've ever had. Spoilers: my stomach was not happy with me, and my reckoning came a few hours later with a hellfire inferno in my gut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we decided to do a few more things before leaving for Flagstaff. While we didn't really have time to go back downtown (sorry, no pictures), we hit up this... art project thing, called &lt;a href="https://meowwolf.com/"&gt;Meow Wolf&lt;/a&gt;. It's like this interactive art-plus-story-plus-mystery-interactive-amusement-thing. It's hard to describe, but you try to derive the story via context clues... and they're everywhere. It was an insane experience, and is basically a point of pride and joy for residents of the city. I can see why. &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/04/inside-meow-wolf-the-amusement-park-for-people-who-want-a-weirder-disneyland/"&gt;Here's a writeup about it&lt;/a&gt;. It's also the local maker space, which is really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we went to the Santa Fe Botanical Garden, where one of our hosts works (we had a free pass!). It was really serene, and well designed. We saw some beautiful desert plant life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, we could only stay in The City Different for so long, and by twoish, we were on our way to Flagstaff. 75 mph highways all the way, so I felt slightly less guilty going 90ish during the more secluded portions of the trip. The car handles really well, but it's small, and the crosswinds actually push us around quite a bit. It felt nice driving that fast without worrying about cops or other drivers, that's for sure. It was a quiet, but beautiful drive. Many trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our timing was perfect, and we arrived to the sight of a wonderful sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...And are elated to roam the streets of &lt;strong&gt;Santa Fe&lt;/strong&gt;, what may be the most adorable town in the entire country. It became immediately apparent that if New Orleans was a mecca for jazz, Santa Fe is a mecca for art. There are endless galleries, and there is no way we're going to be able to appreciate even five percent of what this awesome town has to offer. It was worth the drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is saying something, because the drive itself was the most boring one yet. Going along the Texas/Oklahoma border yielded nothing of interest at all. Except one pit-stop that had an auto museum, that was kind of cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We couldn't take any decent pictures - the town is really kind of short and narrow. The buildings are almost like... mud/clay buildings, except that's just an exterior shell. I'm not really sure what's up with the aesthetic, but it's hilariously cute, and super unique. It's really hard to get good angles of the streets to see anything of value, but there is value there in spades. We intend to go tomorrow morning, and will try our best to take pictures of some sites and sights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in Santa Fe, it was only appropriate that we had some Spanish style food. We meandered into &lt;a href="http://elmeson-santafe.com/"&gt;El Mason&lt;/a&gt;, and were rewarded with a fantastic meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our AirBnB room this time is with a young couple who are super chill and awesome. The house is beautiful, and we traded some VT goodies for some NM goodies. Two pepper beers? What's a pepper beer... We'll have to try it tomorrow when not on the road...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll spend some more time in Santa Fe, tomorrow. As per usual - fantastic town/city, and deserving of its own trip. We depart early tomorrow afternoon for &lt;strong&gt;Flagstaff, AZ&lt;/strong&gt;. We won't be seeing the Grand Canyon tomorrow, though. Rather, we'll likely go the following day super early to see it at sunrise. Dope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...So they know that we're a-ok. We left &lt;strong&gt;New Orleans&lt;/strong&gt; early and made a relatively uneventful trek across the bayou, sticking to the interstate. I read on a blog post somewhere that people from Louisiana are secretly afraid of accidentally driving into the bayou, so I just decided to not go near it, and admire the majestically ugly swampy areas... or what little I saw of them along the way. The state as a whole is flat, but hardly flattering. Gassing back up at a midpoint stop along the way, I noticed a police officer handling what appeared to be a very, very large gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on guns later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we approached Dallas, we had a barbecue lunch at one of the endless barbecue smokehouses across the state. It was pretty good. We were too hungry, and forgot to take any pictures. Sorry about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, through some idle google searching, we found out that the Dallas State Fair is going on this entire month! Eager to attend, we purchased two tickets and took the detour. Overall, Aron enjoyed himself, but it's not really my thing... the prices made the Champlain Valley Fair look like a steal, and the place was teeming with teenagers on dates, or parents with tots. We perused the grounds briefly before splitting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We called into our AirBnB room, and informed the owners that we'd be arriving late due to the diversion. They were cool with it. Cool people in general - a couple and their mother. A very welcoming home, and the room is nice, albeit the whole house is adorned with more crosses than I knew could be acquired before being labeled a hoarder. We got to chatting, about our trip, a little bit about sailing (thanks, Gary!), comparing Texas to Vermont in terms of people and hobbies, and right as we were about to turn in, we touch on the subject of guns. Oh do these guys love their guns - they're collectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would normally go into this in a lot of detail, but for many of you - this is no big deal. However, I promise you that my parents are already horrified. So that's why I'm going to post this picture, because in for a penny, in for a pound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...Because there is still so much left to see and do. So many more music venues to check out. More events and festivals to attend. More people to see and meet. You are a city that only knows how to breathe and thrive and live, and you conveyed that to me all to well in only two days. I don't want to go to sleep, because it would mean that my stay here has concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We slept in (only a little bit!) today, getting some &lt;em&gt;much needed&lt;/em&gt; rest, and promptly made a beeline for &lt;a href="http://www.cafedumonde.com/"&gt;Café du Monde&lt;/a&gt; - a huge outdoor cafe, and one of the most famous ones in the world. We waited in a line - one that could so easily be cut - and were rewarded with some really good live music right on the side of the street that started up as we arrived. Lucky! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon getting to the front of the line, we realized just how packed this place is. It's organized chaos, with waiters expertly coordinating their various sections, rushing coffee and beignets to various customers. An older couple was ahead of us about to find a table, but since they seated four, I invited myself and Aron into their company. They were all too happy to oblige, and when we were finally seated, we got to talking about road trips. It was a good conversation, as they themselves were vacationing veterans, and shared with us some of their experiences. Our choice of food was all too simple. Café au Lait and beignets (sort of doughnut-ish). Iconic and necessary. The chicory coffee was so great, that I grabbed seconds - iced - to go.  Other snacks of the day: pralines (a sort of pecan fudge-toffee thing), and snow cones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the café, we meandered into the Frenchman Quarter Market, and perused the shops with all of their nicknacks on display. We spent quite some time just hanging around and listening to the music on the streets, and roaming the quarter. Aron informed me later that we had walked upwards of six miles. I believe it. Along the way, I fell victim to a street artist, dressed creepily in all while with white skin-paint and white lipstick, who tapped me on the shoulder. I jumped. Upon reading the sign by her feet, "If you holla, you owe me a dolla", I obliged and dropped a single into the bucket by her feet. She winked and blew me a kiss. That was a good start to the day. I wish I took a picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, just before sunset, we grabbed dinner at &lt;a href="http://www.royalhouserestaurant.com/"&gt;Royal House&lt;/a&gt; - a bowl of iconic gumbo. It was fantastic. I added in some Crystal Made-in-Louisiana hot sauce, because I ain't no wimp. It burned so good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I craved more music and booze, so we returned to Frenchman Street after sunset. Sunday proved to be a lot calmer, but there was still plenty of music to be had. We stopped at a few venues, including the one from the previous night, and were rewarded with some great blues artists and strong drinks. One drink, in particular - the Hurricane - is a sort of long island iced tea-esque concoction with juice and grenadine... a very dangerous drink. Only the thought of a severe hangover before an eight hour drive the next day got us back to the hotel at a "reasonable" hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...leaving &lt;strong&gt;Atlanta&lt;/strong&gt; behind us after a very short stop. There was a tiny bit of hotel shenanigans from the night before, where the lady (older, very caucasian) at the desk insisted I had booked two nights, instead of one. I was also apparently named Ms. Angwe Something. I think she confused "Eitan" for "Anekwe" - the surname of someone else in the system, I presume. I told her as much. She insisted that she was correct, as is the right of one's elders, and that this was just one of the many oddities of "booking third party". She cancelled the second night, and we slept - no harm no foul. The next morning, I went to the front desk, where the lady (younger, African American) immediately looked at me funny and said "Angwe?". I could only reply, "Apparently". "But that's a Nigerian last name. You don't look Nigerian...". What else could I respond except simply, "I agree". We had a laugh. I hope no one was left without a room due these shenanigans beyond my control.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to play it by ear, and allow ourselves to get distracted a bit today, after the very boring drive yesterday. We stopped at a place called &lt;a href="http://www.firstwatch.com/"&gt;First Watch&lt;/a&gt;, in Montgomery, Alabama. Apparently, this is a pretty well-known chain, but Aron and I have never been. The food was farm-fresh with "healthy options". I opted for a safer breakfast of eggs and its likely companions (dubbed the "Traditional Breakfast"), whereas Aron went after some breakfast tacos with Chorizo (I think), avocado, tomato, beans, and other goodies. Many of you know that I'm a picky eater, and I'm pleased to say that he had the tastier meal of the two of us (though mine was still really good!). Impressed with their granola, I grabbed a bag for the road. Their coffee was also really good. Overall, it was a really solid brunch, and I'd be likely to go back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After leaving Montgomery - it's a bit like Albany, in that it's not all that interesting of a place for a capital - we headed southwest towards &lt;strong&gt;New Orleans&lt;/strong&gt;, but decided to go an hour south out of the way to &lt;strong&gt;Gulf Shores Beach, Alabama&lt;/strong&gt; and stick our toes in the sand. There were plenty of other people, but we found a spot to sit and relax. It was a welcome break from seeing roads for hours on end, and the time we allotted ourselves flew by in the blink of an eye. A bittersweet theme of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we arrived at New Orleans at sunset. Seeing swampland was a bit of a surprise, and we drove miles over water. We left the car with valet parking, and I obviously forgot my go pro in there, so I'll have to upload the few video clips I took later. After checking into our hotel (so fancy), we immediately went to Frenchman Street, where we filled our bellies with some pulled pork sandwiches. Stomachs filled, we roamed around, taking in our fill of artwork on display (for sale, of course), and live jazz music. Words don't really do it justice. It truly is a party, daily, in a city that never sleeps. Whereas Vegas has always felt like the party was a business, New Orleans feels like the party is a lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got back to the hotel at around Midnight (it's 1 A.M. personal time, and we woke up really early today...). We're completely spent. Aron and I are going to sleep in a bit tonight, and head to the French Quarter tomorrow during the day, when it's generally safer to roam around and explore. If we're feeling brave, we'll check out Bourbon Street (tons of debauchery, and sinful pleasures for all types) tomorrow. If we feel out of our league, I may drag us back to Frenchman Street for more live music. It really was fantastic, and New Orleans warrants an entire vacation of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After today, I think it's finally sunk in that I'm on a road trip around the country. It didn't feel real until now. I've never been so far out of my comfort zone (who would honestly call &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; adventurous?) before. It's kind of nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a bit long-winded today - we did a lot! We've also passed the 1500 mile mark, so that's neat.

&lt;p&gt;...We successfully arrived in &lt;strong&gt;Atlanta&lt;/strong&gt;, dodging hurricane Matthew. The trip was mildly beautiful, when the skies weren't completely overcast. There were many religious billboards, more than I was expecting, which was a surprise. Food consisted of on-the-road offerings, including a stop at Chik-fil-A, since I've never been. It was pretty good, though the flavor lacked a notable taste of social equality. Overall, a lot of driving, and not a whole lot of other stuff. The price of a road trip that is "only" a month long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that since I'm actually getting over my newest flavor of contagion, I'd crash the daily maskhouse IT team scrum meeting. My manager affirmed that I am indeed a dedicated employee. I mean, we don't see Gary showing up to scrum meetings during &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; vacation, just saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, Aron's favorite song came on. Not safe for work language, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out all of the hotels around here are crammed full of people finding refuge from the hurricane. We're hoping for an early rise tomorrow so we can spend as much time in &lt;strong&gt;New Orleans&lt;/strong&gt; as possible - though Aron looks to be working on some film editing for work, so we'll see if he wakes up tomorrow sans physical intervention. New Orleans is one of my most anticipated stops!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...despite the fact that I'm fighting a pretty bad cold right from the start of my trip. We got to see a lot in just our one day of rest, here. We had brunch at one of the &lt;a href="http://www.wearefoundingfarmers.com/"&gt;Founding Farmers&lt;/a&gt; locations, which was pretty fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async defer src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, it was straight to the National Mall - I had never been before - to see some of the must-see sights. As per usual, check &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/eitanromanoff/"&gt;my instagram&lt;/a&gt;, or maybe &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/ar0ney/"&gt;Aron's&lt;/a&gt; eventually, for more pictures.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all of the sites, I think I appreciated the WWII memorial, Lincoln memorial, and the Library of Congress the most. The WWII memorial was very stoic in how it was all laid out, as if it was only natural that it would rest there for decades or centuries to come. One doesn't get the sense of scale when looking at a penny for the Lincoln memorial - it was massive. Really impressive. The Library of Congress was immense as well - I wish I could have gone inside the library proper. Guess I'll have to become a senator or something.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dinner at a fantastic Thai place (sorry, was sick and feeling poopy, no pictures), and an early doze. Aron and I are up now, ready to start our hike down to &lt;strong&gt;Atlanta&lt;/strong&gt; - this will be a long trek. We'll likely use 81 into 85, since according to my co-worker Lee, it's more scenic. If it disappoints, I'll let her know that she ruined what is &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; the best part of the trip.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Day One (D.C.)</title><link href="https://eartsar.github.io/blog/day-one-dc.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-06T00:44:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-06T00:44:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Eitan Romanoff</name></author><id>tag:eartsar.github.io,2016-10-06:blog/day-one-dc.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;So we were off to a great start...&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...When I called in this morning to see what's up with my amazon prime package containing the rest of my trip items I had ordered last week. Delayed, apparently (return to sender, please!). I also caught a really bad cold, but it's not the flu! Even if it was, I think the trip would continue regardless. Things can only get better from here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip started beautifully with wonderful autumn foliage throughout Vermont. This ended as we bounced from one highway to another throughout NY, NJ, Delaware, and Maryland. It all paid off, though, with a prompt arrival in D.C. just after sunset. We met up with an old college buddy and his fiancée immediately upon arrival. Dropped off our stuff, and went into Alexandria, Virginia for dinner. The streets were relatively quiet, but it was still bright and welcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early rise tomorrow for the D.C. adventure. &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/eitanromanoff/"&gt;My Instagram&lt;/a&gt; has a few pictures on it, with more to come in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Get Ready</title><link href="https://eartsar.github.io/blog/get-ready.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-04T18:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-04T18:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Eitan Romanoff</name></author><id>tag:eartsar.github.io,2016-10-04:blog/get-ready.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;About This Trip&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are this isn't coming as a complete surprise to you, if you're reading this, but I'm going on a road trip. My first, actually. I've got some pretty horrible company, and we'll undoubtedly be listening to King Kunta on repeat for hours. &lt;strong&gt;It's my first lap around the country&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;a href="https://roadtrippers.com/map?a2=t!10381588&amp;amp;lat=36.40037&amp;amp;lng=-110.68699&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trip&amp;amp;utm_medium=share&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;z=4"&gt;Roadtrippers Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all destinations are listed there, nor are those the actual routes we'll be taking. I expect quite a bit of meandering along the way. Here's a condensed itinerary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Washington D.C.&lt;/strong&gt;, I'll be meeting up with my college friend Bryce, and he's going to take us into D.C. proper and Alexandria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atlanta&lt;/strong&gt;, a pass-through. If the show was any indication, I'm quite okay with that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Orleans&lt;/strong&gt;, we'll be staying right on the French Quarter on a Saturday and Sunday. Hoping for plenty of jazz and creole style food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then on to &lt;strong&gt;Dallas&lt;/strong&gt;, passing through. Screw Texas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Santa Fe&lt;/strong&gt;, passing through, but we'll have some time to look around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ah... the &lt;strong&gt;Grand Canyon&lt;/strong&gt;, the American Wonder that's allegedly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; overrated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that, we're going to go straight to &lt;strong&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/strong&gt;, where we'll be meeting up with a dozen or so friends of mine. Three days. We've got shows planned here, but since people from work might be reading this, I can't go into more detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meandering north will take us to &lt;strong&gt;Sacramento&lt;/strong&gt;, where we'll be staying with more friends. We'll spend a day in San Fransisco while we're here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A long hike north, passing &lt;strong&gt;Crater Lake&lt;/strong&gt; on the way, will take us to &lt;strong&gt;Portland&lt;/strong&gt;. Childhood friend lives there, and hopefully we'll be staying with her. A rest day follows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An even &lt;em&gt;longer&lt;/em&gt; hike gets us to &lt;strong&gt;Rigby&lt;/strong&gt; in Idaho, just an hour out from Yellowstone. We'll meander through the next day (the whole day!), and end up in &lt;strong&gt;Cody&lt;/strong&gt;, Wyoming. It's supposed to be beautiful. Two nights in a cabin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heading over to &lt;strong&gt;Rapid City&lt;/strong&gt; for Rushmore - an American Wonder that allegedly &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; overrated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minneapolis is up next. Passing through, but we'll take our time in doing so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big stop next in &lt;strong&gt;Chicago&lt;/strong&gt;! Staying with a bunch of friends there. Looking forward to Second City comedy club! Three days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After which, just a hop and skip away, is &lt;strong&gt;Sandusky&lt;/strong&gt;, Ohio - Cedar Point time. I'm still a kid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rochester&lt;/strong&gt;, New York. We have a Halloween party to attend with some college buddies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If all goes well, I'll reach &lt;strong&gt;Burlington&lt;/strong&gt; on the 2nd of November.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
